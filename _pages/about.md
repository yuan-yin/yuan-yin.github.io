My research focuses on machine learning and deep learning for (spatio)temporal sequence modeling, prediction, and analysis of complex behaviors. 

I have explored the following directions in the past few years, with a special emphasis on physical dynamical systems: 
- improving neural network-based dynamics modeling by **leveraging physical models**,
- extending the **adaptation and out-of-distribution generalization** power of neural networks for dynamics modeling, and
- handling free-form data and **predicting phenomena continuously** in time and space. 

I successfully defended my [PhD thesis](https://www.theses.fr/2023SORUS161) in June 2023 at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr "prev. UPMC (Paris 6)"), supervised by Prof. [Patrick Gallinari](https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/gallinari/) and Assoc. Prof. [Nicolas Baskiotis](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/baskiotis/). 

Prior to that, I earned my BSc in Computer Science from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) back in 2016, followed by an MSc in Computer Science from [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr "ex-Paris-Diderot (Paris 7)") (M1 [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php "Master Parisien de Recherche en Informatique")) and [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr "ex-UPMC (Paris 6)") (M2 [DAC](https://dac.lip6.fr/master/ "Données, Apprentissage, Connaissances")) in 2019.
