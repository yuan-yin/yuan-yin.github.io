My research focuses on machine learning and deep learning for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, simulation, prediction, and analysis of complex behaviors. I also explore methods to extend the generalization of data-driven models, particularly through model adaptation.

<!-- I have explored the following directions in the past few years, with a special emphasis on physical dynamical systems: 
- **physics dynamics modeling** with neural networks,
- **adaptation and out-of-distribution generalization** of neural networks, and
- **handling free-form data** and predicting phenomena continuously in time and space.  -->

I defended my [PhD](https://www.theses.fr/2023SORUS161) in June 2023 at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr "prev. UPMC (Paris 6)"), under the supervision of Prof. [Patrick Gallinari](https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/gallinari/) and Assoc. Prof. [Nicolas Baskiotis](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/baskiotis/). Before that, I obtained my BSc in Computer Science from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) in 2016, followed by an MSc in Computer Science from [Université Paris Cité](https://u-paris.fr "prev. Paris-Diderot (Paris 7)") (M1 [MPRI](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php "Master Parisien de Recherche en Informatique")) and [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr "prev. UPMC (Paris 6)") (M2 [DAC](https://dac.lip6.fr/master/ "Données, Apprentissage, Connaissances")) in 2018-2019.
