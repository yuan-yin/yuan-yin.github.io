Hello, I'm Yuan Yin, currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the [MLIA Team](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/equipes/mlia/) at [ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr), [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr).

My research focuses on machine learning and deep learning for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, prediction, and analysis of complex behaviors, with a special emphasis on physical dynamical systems. 

I have explored the following directions in the past years: improving neural network-based dynamics modeling by leveraging physical models through hybrid modeling; extending the generalization power of dynamics models by learning commonalities from data of different dynamics to extrapolate to unseen systems; and handling free-form data and continuously predicting phenomena in time and space through continuous modeling. 

I successfully defended my [PhD thesis](https://www.theses.fr/2023SORUS161) in June 2023, under the supervision of Professor [Patrick Gallinari](https://pages.isir.upmc.fr/gallinari/) and Associate Professor [Nicolas Baskiotis](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/personnel/baskiotis/). Prior to that, I earned my BSc in Computer Science from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn) in 2016, followed by an MSc in Computer Science from [Paris Cit√© University](https://u-paris.fr) and [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr) in 2019.
